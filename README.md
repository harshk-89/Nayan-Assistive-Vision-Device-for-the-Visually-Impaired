# Nayan - Assistive Vision Device for the Visually Impaired

**Nayan** is an offline, AI-powered assistive vision system designed for visually impaired users. It integrates voice feedback, object detection, face recognition, and image-to-text capabilities into a single device.

## üîß Modules

### üîä Voice Module (`pyttsx3`)
This module converts text into speech using `pyttsx3`. We use this library because it works offline, which ensures the device functions even in environments without internet connectivity. It helps the user understand situations via real-time audio feedback.

---

### üñºÔ∏è Image-to-Text Module (`EasyOCR`)
This module extracts text from images using `EasyOCR`, a robust and deep learning-based OCR system. The extracted text is then passed to the Voice Module for audio playback to the user.

---

### üë§ Face Detection Module (`face_recognition`, `dlib`, `cv2`)
This module performs face detection and recognition using a known dataset of face images. It encodes all faces during initialization. During operation:
- It matches captured faces with known encodings.
- If a match is found with high confidence, it announces the name.
- If no confident match is found, it informs that the face is unknown.

**Core logic:**
```python
# Refer to face_recognition.py in module3
# Recognizes faces and uses pyttsx3 for voice feedback
````

---

### üß† Object Detection Module (`YOLOv8`)

This module uses YOLOv8 (`ultralytics`) for live object detection. Key features:

* Detects objects in real-time.
* Annotates images with object names and distance labels (close/far).
* Saves annotated images for review.

**Sample Code Snippet:**

```python
# Refer to yolov8_detect.py in module4
# Detects and counts objects, saves annotated images
```
